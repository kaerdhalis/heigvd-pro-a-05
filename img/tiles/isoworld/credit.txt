This file was included for your convenience. I know a lot of
times I've downloaded a ton of stuff from OGA and had to go
back and actually look up *who* made it all because I didn't make
notes of it at the time.

You don't have to include this because these files are part of public domain, but I wouldn't mind if you did :P

If you want to say thanks, leave a shout in the comment section on OGA,
or send me an email with your game, I'm always interested to play new
stuff. Cheers!
